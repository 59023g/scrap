### web scrapper
Girlfriend at the time wanted a very specific 1950s Wedgewood apartment size stove ( 26inches wide ). Very rare. And hard to find in San Francisco. So I built this scraper which, every hour, searched those terms within a few hundred mile radius of the city and then texted her a photograph of the results. 

After a few months, and many text messages, we got a hit from up in Sacramento. A few days later we had a ( semi-functional ) stove. Soon thereafter I got it repaired. And it worked! Great.
